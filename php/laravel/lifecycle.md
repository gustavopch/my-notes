# Request lifecycle

The entry point for all requests is the `public/index.php` file.

- It loads the autoloader generated by Composer;
- Gets an instance of the application from `bootstrap/app.php`;
- Sends the request to the `app/Http/Kernel.php` which returns a response.

Differently from Node.js, all the code you see in PHP is bound to the request. The whole thing is bootstrapped every time a new request comes.
